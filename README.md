### Referendum in Catalonia - explorative data analysis on social media presence
The goal is to compare the English social media presence during the Catalonian independence referendum and the consequent march against the independence of Catalonia. We want to explore the characteristics of different types of people who voiced their opinion about the independence referendum. The results of our analysis can offer insights for researchers, political organizers and public at large.

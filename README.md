##### Introduction to Data Science, Fall 2017, University of Helsinki  

#### Short description  
The goal is to obtain data-driven insight from social media reflection of two political events in Spain - the 08.10.2017 march against the independence of Catalonia, and on 10.10.2017 during and after Puigdemont's conclusive speech. For this purpose we use publicly available tools (open source, open data) and exploratory data analysis methods. The information, obtained from our analyses, could be useful for researchers, sociologists, politicians, and the public at large.

#### Data  
We extracted two data sets (one from 08.10.2017 and one from 10.10.2017) from Twitter using their search API, and pre-processed it with suitable python libraries. See scripts for more detailed information.

#### Data analysis  
We performed basic data analysis using Explorative Data Analysis-techniques and sentiment analysis.

- differences (and similarities) between social media presence and referendum results  
- use of socal media (e.g. Twitter) data in Political Science and Sociological research

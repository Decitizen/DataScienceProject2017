### Referendum in Catalonia - Explorative data analysis on social media presence
Pitch: 
The goal is to compare the social media presence during the 08.10.2017 march against the independence of Catalonia, and on 10.10.2017 during and after Puigdemont's conclusive speach. We are interested in the types of people who voiced their opinions, and how the situation was discussed on social media. The results of our analysis can offer insights for researchers, political organizers and public at large.

Data:
We will try to extract data from Twitter and Facebook using their APIs, and handle it with suitable python libraries. Privacy issues will be taken into account and the data will be anonymized. 

Data analysis: 
We will perform sentiment analysis on the data to get information on the division between different twets (pro- or anti-independence). 

Communication of results: 
We will summarize and graph the results for easier communication.

Operalization:
The results of this project can be linked to many different fields and topics, such as:
- differences (and similarities) between social media presence and referendum results
- use of socal media (e.g. Twitter) data in Political Science 
- use of social media for data mining

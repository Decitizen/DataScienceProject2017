    "# Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "###  Principles of analytic graphics (by Edward Tuffey)\n",
    "Primary Source: [Coursera: Exploratory data analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis)\n",
    "#### 1. Show Comparisons\n",
    "* Differences can only be recognized in relation to something 'other'\n",
    "* $ \\implies $ hypothesis can only be made in relation to a given context\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure\n",
    "* What is __the possible causal mechanism/explanation__ behind the particular phenomenon?\n",
    "* Think about how to further investigate and best communicate the mechanisms to public\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.  Show multivariate data\n",
    "* World is inherently multi-dimensional\n",
    "* Don't adhere to oversimplifications/overt reductionism\n",
    "* Show as much data and richness as is possible without making the graphical presentation messy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Integration of evidence\n",
    "* Don't only show a plot or a table -> combine different medias in order to help different people to get the max amount of information out of your presentation\n",
    "* Don't let the tools restrict you $ \\implies $ __*don't create the plot that the tool easily lets you to make, instead make the graph that you want to create*__ \n",
    "* Operate outside of the box and try to create a multi-media presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Describe and document the evidence with approriate labels, scales, ques, sources\n",
    "* Make the story as credible as possible \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Content is the king\n",
    "* Ensure that your narrative carries meaning and purpose\n",
    "* No amount of presentation and presentation techniques makes a empty narrative interesting "
